# Milestone 2: System Design & UI Prototyping

## System Architecture
The Expense Report Generator project follows a modular architecture that separates the concerns of different components. The main components of the system architecture include:

1. **Frontend:** Implements the user interface using React.js, where users can interact with the application.
2. **Backend:** A Node.js/Express server handles requests and manages the database connections.
3. **Database:** Utilizes MongoDB to store user data, expense records, and report templates.
4. **Authentication:** Leverages JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.

## Wireframes
The following wireframes represent the basic layout of the application:
- **Home Page:** Overview of the user's expense reports with options to add new reports and view existing ones.
- **Report Creation Page:** A form for entering expense details, including date, category, amount, and comments.
- **Report Submission Page:** A summary of the report for review before submission.

## UI Prototyping
UI prototyping tools such as Figma or Adobe XD will be utilized to create interactive prototypes. Key elements include:
- Consistent branding and color theme throughout the application.
- Intuitive navigation and user experience designs to simplify expense reporting.
- Responsive design considerations to ensure functionality across devices.

The UI prototypes will be tested with users to gather feedback and iterate on design improvements.
